## Viewing This Project ##
Eventually I'd like to host this site on GitHub pages, but for the time being I'm going to keep things simple. For now, open this project in GitHub Codespaces if it's available to you, otherwise clone the repository and install the dependencies with NPM like any other Node project.

```
npm install
npm run start
```
